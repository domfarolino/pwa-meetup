# pwa-meetup
Basic SPA PWA for meetup

This ever-so-basic application was used as a demo for the [Node Cinci PWA Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXAOGZ3Gw4U).
At the end of the talk, I demonstrate the necessary steps to take when turning a web application
into a Progressive Web Application by adding a web app manifest, service worker, caching logic, and more!

The steps to take to get this web application offline are in the form of the sequential branches and are as follows:

 - [01-Pre-PWA](https://github.com/domfarolino/pwa-meetup)
 - [02-Manifest](https://github.com/domfarolino/pwa-meetup/tree/02-Manifest)
 - [03-Add-SW](https://github.com/domfarolino/pwa-meetup/tree/03-Add-SW)
 - [04-Offline](https://github.com/domfarolino/pwa-meetup/tree/04-Offline)
 - [05-Full-Offline](https://github.com/domfarolino/pwa-meetup/tree/05-Full-Offline)
